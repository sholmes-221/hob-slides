# Discussion 

- Many young people in China are addicted to 剧本杀 (Live Action Role Playing (LARP) games/murder mystery game)

- They feel a sense of achievement and joy when the murder is solved 

- How do you feel after the mystery is revealed in the Bible?
    - Do you feel joy? Do you feel that this is enjoyable? 
    - Why or why not?

---

# Application  

- There are many other mysteries in the Bible that are not fully revealed, e.g. in the book of Job 

- Can you give some other examples? 

- What should we do when faced with these mysteries? Does it affect our belief in God?

# A Prayer for the Ephesians

> 16 I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, 17 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, 18 may have power, together with all the Lord’s holy people, `to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, 19 and to know this love that surpasses knowledge`—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.

# Discussion
