# Submit Yourselves to God

> 1 What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from your desires that battle within you?
2 You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God.
3 When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.
4 You adulterous people, don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.

---

> 6 But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: “God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.”
7 Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
8 Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
9 Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom.
10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.

---

> 11 Brothers and sisters, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against a brother or sister or judges them speaks against the law and judges it. When you judge the law, you are not keeping it, but sitting in judgment on it.
12 There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy. But you—who are you to judge your neighbor?

# Application 

> 2 You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God.
3 When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.

- Why James asks us to pray? 

---

- Believers should ask God for what they seek rather than fighting each other

- James does not imply that God wills to grant sinful, selfish desires (4:3), but bringing requests before God can have a purifying influence on one’s desires
    - We can reflect on what we ask, and allow the Holy Spirit to guide us

# Boasting About Tomorrow

> 13 Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.”
14 Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
15 Instead, you ought to say, “If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that.”
16 As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil.
17 If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them.

# Discussion

> 14 Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.

- What's your experience with that accident, or any accident?

- Accidents like 9/11 might happen, so we should not be presumptuous and arrogant when making our plans

- Does that mean we should not make plans, invest, etc? 

---

# Discussion

- Planning and investing are not wrong, but arrogant self-confidence and boasting are

- ✅ Nehemiah needs to plan before rebuilding the temple 

- ❌ Belshazzar's feast, or the story of the writing on the wall

- Any other examples? 

---

# The writing on the wall

> Belshazzar holds a great feast and drinks from the vessels that had been looted in the destruction of the First Temple. A hand appears and writes on the wall. 
Daniel reminds Belshazzar his father Nebuchadnezzar, when he became arrogant, was thrown down until he learned that God has sovereignty over the kingdom of men (see Daniel 4). Belshazzar had likewise blasphemed God, and so God sent this hand. 

- That very night Belshazzar the Chaldean (Babylonian) king was killed, and Darius the Mede received the kingdom. (Daniel 5:30–31)

# Writing's on the Wall 

- Theme song for the film Spectre

```
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you’re not here I’m suffocating
I want to feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing’s on the wall
```

- It is not only what people do that matters; the good that they fail to do is equally important to God

- Any examples of `sins of omission`, and reflections? 
    - My experience with a beggar in Bugis
