# My trip to Boston 

- August, 2017, I was on a trip to `Boston`, there is a nice youth hotel beside the Boston Commons park 
- However, there would be a `right-wing protest` near the park based on the news, so I did not book that youth hotel

# Theology vs Ethics 

- From the book: 

> Paul surely would scratch his head at that practice of many Christian seminaries and universities to separate the study of `right thinking` (theology) from `right living` (ethics) into separate courses, or even separate departmentments.

---

# Theology vs Ethics 

- The gospel that saves us must take on blood and bones in the lives of God's people, or it morphs into something other than the gospel 

- On May 10, 1940, Winston Churchill became Prime Minister. When he met his Cabinet on May 13 he told them that 

> I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.

# Suffering  

- [*It Is Well with My Soul*](https://youtu.be/zY5o9mP22V0) is a hymn by `Horatio Spafford`
- This hymn was written after traumatic events in Spafford's life
- After a shipwreck, his wife said: "Saved alone …"
```
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say
It is well, it is well with my soul
```

# Philippians 1:19-30 

## To Live Is Christ

> Yes, and I will rejoice, 19 for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, 20 as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. 

---

# Philippians 1:19-30 

> 21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 22 If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. 23 I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. 

---

# Philippians 1:19-30 

> 24 But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. 25 Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, 26 so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.  

---

# Philippians 1:19-30 

> 27 Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel, 

---

# Philippians 1:19-30 

> 28 and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God. `29 For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake, 30 engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.`

# Reflection 

- Is the church called to suffer for Christ in your context? 
  - If so, in what ways?
  - If not, why not?

# <!--fit--> 2 Corinthians 12:1-10 

> I must go on boasting. Though there is nothing to be gained by it, I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. 2 I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows.

--- 

# <!--fit--> 2 Corinthians 12:1-10 

> 3 And I know that this man was caught up into paradise—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows— 4 and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter. 5 On behalf of this man I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses— 6 though if I should wish to boast, I would not be a fool, for I would be speaking the truth; but I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me.

---

# 2 Corinthians 12:1-10 

> `7 So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited.` 8 Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me.

---

# 2 Corinthians 12:1-10 

> 9 But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

# Reflection 

- What is your response to the notion of suffering as a gift of God? 
- Have you ever found that to be true in your own life?

# <!--fit--> Job 3 - Job Laments His Birth 

```
20 “Why is light given to him who is in misery,
    and life to the bitter in soul,
21 who long for death, but it comes not,
    and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,
22 who rejoice exceedingly
    and are glad when they find the grave?
23 Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,
    whom God has hedged in?
24 For my sighing comes instead of[a] my bread,
    and my groanings are poured out like water.
25 For the thing that I fear comes upon me,
    and what I dread befalls me.
26 I am not at ease, nor am I quiet;
    I have no rest, but trouble comes.”
```

# Application 

- Is it a sin to complain to God, even ask for death? 
- How should we still keep our faith strong during suffering?
